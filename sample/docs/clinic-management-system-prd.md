# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Clinic Management System - Pharmacy First

### 1. Project Description

#### Problems

- Pharmacy operations often use spreadsheets or generic POS tools that cannot correctly handle medicine units such as boxes, strips, and pills.
- Stock counts become inaccurate when purchases, sales, returns, and adjustments use different units without reliable conversion.
- Staff may sell partial packs, such as a few pills from a strip, without correct stock deduction or pricing.
- Patient records are often forced into sales flows, slowing checkout and creating unnecessary dependency between modules.
- Lack of audit trails makes it difficult to trace who changed stock, prices, or unit definitions.

#### Aims & Objectives

- Build a pharmacy-first clinic system focused on sales, stock, and complex unit management.
- Support multi-level unit hierarchies, such as box to strip to pill, with accurate conversion.
- Enable fast pharmacy sales workflows, including partial-unit sales.
- Maintain accurate real-time stock using a native multi-unit stock ledger.
- Provide an ultra-minimal patient module for service fee reference only.
- Track income and expenses, including service income linked to patient visit records.
- Exclude complex EHR and scheduling modules to keep the product focused and maintainable.

### 2. Scope of the Project

#### Project Deliverables

##### Unit Management Engine

- Define product-specific unit hierarchies, such as box, strip, and pill.
- Enforce a strict one-to-many relationship between an item/product and its units: one item contains multiple unit levels, and each unit belongs to one item only.
- Configure conversion factors between units.
- Enforce integer stock balances per unit; when selling a smaller unit and only parent stock exists, auto-unpack whole parent units (e.g. 1 box → 10 strips) then deduct from the child unit—never fractional parent deductions (e.g. 0.5 boxes).
- Allow different default units for purchasing and selling.
- Support barcode assignment per unit level.
- Validate unit definitions before saving.

##### Product & Catalog Management

- Manage medicines and products with name, SKU, category, generic name, manufacturer, and status.
- Support batch and expiry tracking where needed.
- Require every unit level inside an item to support its own distinct sale price.
- Search products by name, SKU, or barcode.

##### Stock Management

- Track all stock movements in a multi-unit ledger using the exact `product_unit_id` and quantity used by the transaction.
- Display stock in recognizable user-selected units through the unit relationship service, such as bottles, boxes, strips, or pills.
- Support opening balance, purchase receipt, sales deduction, stock adjustment, wastage, and returns.
- Track batch, lot, and expiry where enabled.
- Show current stock, available stock, and low-stock alerts.
- Support physical stock count and variance adjustment.
- Preserve audit history for stock changes.

##### Pharmacy Sales

- Provide a fast POS screen for pharmacy sales.
- Add sale items by barcode, SKU, or product search.
- Sell products in any allowed unit, such as box, strip, or pill.
- Deduct sale quantities using the selected product unit and the configured unit relationship rules.
- Support discounts, taxes if configured, and multiple payment methods.
- Print or export receipts.
- Allow sale hold and resume.
- Allow sale void or cancellation with stock reversal by authorized users only.

##### Purchasing & Receiving

- Maintain basic supplier records.
- Record purchase receipts by supplier, date, product, exact purchased unit, quantity, and unit cost.
- Support real-world supplier packaging during purchase receiving, such as buying 5 boxes or 20 strips.
- Preserve the exact purchased unit on the receipt and post it to the stock ledger using `product_unit_id` and quantity.
- Store batch and expiry details during receiving where applicable.

##### Reporting

- Stock on hand report.
- Stock movement report.
- Sales report by date, cashier, product, and payment method.
- Low-stock report.
- Expiry and near-expiry report.
- Stock adjustment report.

##### Patient Management

- Maintain master patients (name, age, address) and ultra-minimal visit records (visit datetime only, linked to a master patient).
- Do not store clinical records, history, prescriptions, vitals, notes, or scheduling entities.
- Allow service income records to link directly to a patient visit record when a fee is collected.
- Keep patient creation and visit creation in a strict linear flow: Patient -> Visit -> POS.

##### Income & Expense Tracking

- Record service income, such as consultation or clinic service fees.
- Link service income directly to the ultra-minimal patient record when applicable.
- Record general income categories when needed.
- Record expenses by category, amount, date, payee, and description.
- Provide income, expense, and net summary reports by date range.
- **Unified income transparency (UI):** Detailed income views must show both service/general income (`income_entries`) and completed pharmacy POS sales (`sales`) in one list. Pharmacy sales display with a pseudo-category label **Pharmacy Sale**, linked patient visit, and exact `grand_total`. Database tables stay separate (no copying sales into `income_entries`).

##### Administration

- Manage users and roles.
- Support roles such as Admin, Pharmacist, Cashier, and Stock Manager.
- Maintain audit logs for critical actions.
- Configure pharmacy name, currency, receipt footer, and basic settings.

#### Project Exclusions

- Complex Electronic Health Records (EHR).
- Diagnosis, treatment plans, prescriptions as clinical records, lab results, and vitals.
- Advanced booking workflows, doctor scheduling, queue management, and temporary intake records.
- Insurance claims and third-party billing.
- Patient portal or telemedicine.
- Multi-branch inventory in MVP.
- Loyalty programs and advanced CRM.
- Complex hardware integrations beyond barcode scanner and receipt printer support.

#### Project Constraints

- Pharmacy sales, stock, and unit management are the highest priority.
- Patient management must remain ultra-minimal and decoupled.
- Unit relationship calculation errors can corrupt stock, so this area requires strong validation and testing.
- Stock ledger updates must be transactional to prevent partial updates.
- MVP should avoid features that push the project into full hospital or EHR scope.
- The system should be designed for Laravel and Pest testing.

#### Assumptions

- The first version supports one clinic or pharmacy location.
- Products may have different unit structures.
- Each item/product owns its own unit levels, and units are not shared globally across unrelated items.
- Stock ledger rows store the transaction unit and quantity directly instead of forcing all quantities into one backend unit.
- Stock screens must use the unit relationship service to calculate and display user-recognizable inventory across related units.
- Barcode scanners behave like keyboard input.
- Staff understand common pharmacy units but need the system to prevent mistakes.
- Offline mode is not required in MVP.
- English UI is acceptable for the first release.

### 3. Requirements Specification

#### Phase 6: Bug Fixes, Enhancements, And Operational Improvements *(Active)*

> **Status:** Active. Technical breakdown: `docs/phase-6-technical-design-and-tasks.md`.

- User management (including password reset).
- Role management.
- Permission management (screen and route access only; not per-feature permissions).
- POS add-to-cart stock validation.
- Parent-unit breakdown at POS (sell child unit from parent-unit stock; model-backed).
- Patient module (major feature; evolves Phase 4 visit-only data).
- Patients: auto-generated unique ID, name, age, address.
- Visit records per patient: visit datetime, stackable diagnosis, charges and fees.
- Patient management: master patients are created and edited only from the **Patients** screen (sidebar has no separate Patient Visits link).
- New visit records are created **only** from a master patient's detail page (`New Visit`); visit forms capture visit datetime only (patient demographics come from the master record).
- Visit record detail (reachable from patient profile): linked service income, linked pharmacy sales, stackable diagnoses, and diagnosis editing.
- POS optional patient link from today's recent patient visits (latest-first active queue); visits with a completed pharmacy sale are hidden from the dropdown to prevent double-billing.
- Pharmacy sale attaches directly to `patient_visit_record_id` selected from recent visits.

- Strict Patient → Visit UI: no standalone visit list or standalone visit creation screen.
- Dashboard analytics UI with pharmacy-first operations focus:
  - Actionable Stock Alerts: low stock, expiring batches, pending stock counts.
  - Daily Finance: today's service income, today's pharmacy sales, today's expenses, and 7-day revenue trend.
  - Clinic Activity: today's patient visits.
- Dashboard exclusions: complex EHR graphs, patient demographic charts, and deep accounting charts are intentionally excluded to keep the dashboard focused on daily operational actions and high-level financial health.

##### Dashboard (Operational Analytics)

- The dashboard shall prioritize daily operational alerts and high-level financial health only.
- The dashboard shall show actionable stock alerts:
  - Low stock count: products currently below reorder threshold.
  - Expiring batches count: batches expiring within 30 days or already expired with remaining balance.
  - Pending counts: stock counts with `draft` or `submitted` status.
- The dashboard shall show daily finance:
  - Today's service income total from `income_entries`.
  - Today's completed pharmacy sales total from `sales`.
  - Today's expense total from `expense_entries`.
  - 7-day combined revenue trend (service income + completed pharmacy sales).
